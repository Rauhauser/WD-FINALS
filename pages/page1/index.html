                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>As an IT student specializing in cybersecurity, my programming journey has been enriched by a diverse skill set that includes C++, CSS, and HTML. My experience with C++ began early in my academic career, where I developed a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. This robust understanding of C++ has allowed me to tackle complex problems, develop efficient code, and enhance my analytical thinking. Through various projects and coursework, I have honed my ability to write clean, maintainable code, which is crucial for developing secure applications.</p>
                <p>In addition to my proficiency in C++, I have also cultivated a solid understanding of web development through the use of CSS and HTML. These technologies have enabled me to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My expertise in HTML allows me to structure web content effectively, ensuring it is both accessible and search engine friendly. Meanwhile, my skills in CSS have empowered me to design responsive layouts, implement animations, and enhance user interfaces. By combining these skills, I have been able to build comprehensive websites that not only look great but also perform well across different devices and browsers.</p>
                <p>Specializing in cybersecurity, I have learned to integrate these programming skills with a security-first mindset. This involves writing secure code, understanding potential vulnerabilities, and implementing best practices to safeguard applications. My background in C++, CSS, and HTML, coupled with my specialization in cybersecurity, has equipped me with a unique blend of skills that are essential for developing secure and efficient applications in today's digital landscape.</p>
